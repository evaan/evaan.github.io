Since about 2016-17, I have been learning Linux, and around Late 2019-Early 2020 I started my own "homelab", consisting of a Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian.

My method of deploying services at this point consisted of installing a package through a repo, and enabling a systemd service. This worked, but cleaning up configs, and running multiple instances isn't particilarly ideal.  

I knew about Docker, but seeing big commands (which in hindsight were pretty simple), was pretty intimidating so I never decided to learn it. That was, until a few years ago when I started learning Docker Compose, which made
me realize that Docker wasnt nearly as complicated as I thought it was.

Over the years I ended up learning Docker, with my homelab increasing by a few laptops, all running Portainer so I could easily manage containers in each machine.  
In 2022, I purchased a full desktop, housing an i3-10100, and a GTX 960. After a while, I ended up installing Proxmox, with TrueNAS, and Debian.

This is basically how it ran until late last year, when I heard about using NixOS for a homelab. I had learned about NixOS a while ago, but the declarative aspect for desktop seemed a little intimidating.  
However, this steep learning curve did seem interesting, and allows for a modular homelab setup, which lets me share modules between devices.

## Initial Struggles

NixOS is a pretty steep learning curve, and declaring every aspect of your operating system is a pretty daunting process, but it ends up making life so much easier when it's done. Setting up Home Manager
seemed to be more work than it should've been, but it was a set and forget kind of thing, and it applies to all of my systems so it wasn't too bad overall.

### The qBittorrent Kerfuffle

Initially, I wanted to move away from Docker. I'm still not sure why I wanted to do this, as it just made everything harder, especially dealing with tunnelling my torrent client traffic through a VPN.  

I spent so much time looking into alternatives, such as [NixOS Containers](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_Containers). At this point I realized, why am I doing everything other than just using Docker?

## Switching (back) to Docker

After remembering that Docker is the best piece of software in existence, I switched back, using NixOS' OCI Containers, it allowed me to easily declare every container I want... just like docker compose, with extra steps.
But where's the fun in that? A homelab requires constant upkeep and tinkering, that's what makes it a hobby!

Setting up a docker container using Nix is not much more than this:
```nix
{ lib, ...}: {
  imports = [ ../misc/gluetun.nix ];

  virtualisation.oci-containers.containers."qbittorrent" = {
    image = "docker.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:latest";
    autoStart = true;
    dependsOn = [ "gluetun" ];
    extraOptions = [
      "--network=container:gluetun"
      "--memory=4g"
    ];
    environment = {
      PUID = "1000";
      PGID = "1000";
      WEBUI_PORT = "8080";
      TORRENTING_PORT = "6881";
      DOCKER_MODS = "ghcr.io/vuetorrent/vuetorrent-lsio-mod:latest";
    };
    volumes = [
      "qbittorrent-config:/config"
      "/mnt/storage:/media"
      "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro"
    ];
  };
}
```
The code above is my qbittorrent.nix file, which does nothing crazy. It imports gluetun.nix, if it isn't imported before, as qBit and Prowlarr both depend on it.

If you're ever unsure about what option you may need to set something as (for example, setting the network to contianer:gluetun), the sacret texts of [NixOS Options](https://search.nixos.org/options) are there for just that.

## Secrets Management

If you're uploading your OS' config, you'll likely have some strings you don't want public (private keys, passwords, etc.), and you'll want to use a secrets manager to encrypt these if you decide to upload this your flake to the internet.  
The video below is an amazing 3-part guide on how to setup secrets using [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix), and made it super easy to setup:

## I hate NVIDIA (and/or don't know how to configure Plex)

Every service was working pretty well, basically on par with how it was before. Except for Plex, as my server has an GTX 960 as mentioned previously, I need to use the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html) in order for
containers to have access to the GPU. Plex doesn't particularly *need* this in order to operate, although it allows for more transcodes to happen at once vs. transcoding using my CPU.

After enabling NVIDIA in Docker (which for some reason is deprecated, and the replacement doesn't work?) the container has access to the gpu with nvidia-smi, and Plex sees the GPU!
This is progress, but unfortunately Plex still refuses to use the GPU. And ***finally***, after months of searching at this point, I found [this thread](https://forums.plex.tv/t/preferred-hw-transcoder-linux/593507/11), which ended up solving the issue!

## Conclusion

I probably forgot more issues I had, but the repo is [here](https://github.com/evaan/homelab) for anyone interested in having a look.

I'll probably work on this for the rest of time so it'll be always changing, I am currently working on implementing a [tModLoader](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader) server using Nix.

Unlike [Keenan's introduction to homelabbing](https://blog.pirated.tech/posts/servarr/) I think that avoiding overcomplicating is for nerds and removes the whole fun of troubleshooting for weeks.
